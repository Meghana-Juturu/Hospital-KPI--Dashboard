📊 Hospital KPI Dashboard

🏥 About the Project

Healthcare is a rapidly evolving field, and data-driven insights are transforming the way hospitals operate. This Power BI dashboard is designed to help healthcare professionals, administrators, and analysts make informed decisions by visualizing key hospital performance metrics.

With this dashboard, you can:

✅ Monitor Total Patient Admissions over different periods.

✅ Track Average Patient Wait Times and identify bottlenecks.

✅ Evaluate Patient Satisfaction Scores to improve healthcare services.

✅ Analyze Department-wise Patient Distribution to optimize resource allocation.

✅ Understand Gender and Monthly Trends to spot seasonal variations in patient inflow.

🔍 Why This Dashboard Matters?

Hospitals handle vast amounts of data daily. This dashboard transforms raw data into actionable insights, allowing stakeholders to:

Improve operational efficiency by identifying high-traffic periods.

Enhance patient experience by addressing long wait times.

Streamline department resource management with data-driven planning.

Spot trends in hospital visits across gender and age groups.

The dashboard is fully interactive, allowing users to explore hospital data dynamically. By selecting different filters (e.g., Month, Department, or Patient Age), the entire dashboard updates accordingly, providing deeper insights into hospital performance trends.

🚀 How to Use

Download the hospital_dashboard.pbix file from the repository.

Open it in Power BI Desktop.

Load data and refresh to ensure the latest insights are displayed.

Use the interactive slicers (filters) available in the dashboard:

Select Month: Changing the month (e.g., selecting April) will update all visuals to reflect data from that month.

Filter by Department: Choosing a department (e.g., Neurology) will show only the relevant patient statistics.

Adjust Patient Age: Selecting a specific age range refines the insights for that group.

Analyze the updated visualizations and trends dynamically.
