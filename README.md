📊 Hospital KPI Dashboard

🏥 About the Project

This Power BI dashboard provides actionable insights into hospital emergency room (ER) operations by analyzing patient trends, wait times, department referrals, and patient satisfaction. It enables hospital administrators and healthcare professionals to identify key areas of improvement and optimize resources efficiently.

📋 About the Dataset

The Hospital ER Dataset contains 9,216 emergency room (ER) patient records. It includes demographic details, admission data, department referrals, patient wait times, and satisfaction scores. This dataset helps analyze patient flow, department efficiency, and patient experience in a hospital setting.

🗂 Key Features

Patient ID: Unique identifier for each patient.

Admission Date & Time: Timestamp of when the patient was admitted.

Gender & Age: Demographic details of the patient.

Race: Ethnic background of the patient.

Department Referral: The hospital department the patient was referred to.

Admission Flag: Indicates whether the patient was officially admitted or treated as an outpatient.

Satisfaction Score: A score (0-10) representing how satisfied the patient was with their visit.

Wait Time (Minutes): The duration a patient waited before receiving care.

Case Manager Count: Number of case managers assigned to the patient.

📊 Key Findings & Insights

Below are the insights obtained using Power BI, where different slicers were applied to examine patient trends, department efficiency, and satisfaction levels.

1️⃣ Peak ER Visits

The highest ER visits were recorded in August, indicating seasonal spikes in patient flow.

This could be due to seasonal diseases or increased accident rates during that time.

2️⃣ Most Common Department Referrals

Neurology & General Practice had the highest patient referrals.

Orthopedics & Cardiology also had a significant number of patients.

💡 Actionable Insight: These departments may require additional staffing and resources to handle patient load effectively.

3️⃣ Most Affected Age Group

Older Adults (51-65 years) had the highest number of ER visits.

Middle-Aged Adults (36-50 years) were the second most affected.

💡 Actionable Insight: Hospitals should focus on preventive care programs targeting older adults to reduce ER visits.

4️⃣ Departments with the Longest Wait Time

Neurology had the longest average patient wait time at ~36.8 minutes.

Other departments with high wait times include Orthopedics and Cardiology.

💡 Actionable Insight: Optimizing patient triage and scheduling could reduce wait times and improve patient satisfaction.

🚀 Future Work & Improvements

Integrating real-time patient data for live analytics.

Enhancing data analysis using SQL & Python.

Adding machine learning to predict peak ER times and staffing needs.
